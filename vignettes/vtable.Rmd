The `vtable` package serves the purpose of outputting automatic variable documentation that can be easily viewed while continuing to work with data.

`vtable` contains four main functions: `vtable()` (or `vt()`), `sumtable()` (or `st()`),  `labeltable()`, and `dftoHTML()`/`dftoLaTeX()`. 

Please see the vignettes/articles available on these main functions, as well as on the vtable helper functions.
